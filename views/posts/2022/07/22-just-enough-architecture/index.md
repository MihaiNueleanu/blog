"Just enough architecture" is a concept that emphasizes the importance of pragmatically designing IT systems to meet the specific needs of the business. This approach advocates for only architecting an IT system as far as it is needed, rather than over-architecting and adding unnecessary complexity.

One of the key benefits of this approach is that it allows teams to be more agile and responsive to changing needs. By not over-architecting, teams can quickly and easily make changes to their systems as needed, without being bogged down by unnecessary complexity. Additionally, by only architecting an IT system as far as needed, teams can save time and resources that would otherwise be spent on unnecessary design and development.

Another benefit of this approach is that it allows teams to deliver value to their customers more quickly. By not over-architecting, teams can focus on delivering functionality that is immediately valuable to customers, rather than spending time on unnecessary design and development.

However, it's important to note that "just enough architecture" does not mean that teams should skimp on the design of their IT systems. It's still important (and sometimes essential) to have a well-designed system that meets the specific needs of the business. It means finding the balance between having a flexible system that can evolve over time, and not over-engineering the system.

In summary, "just enough architecture" is a concept that emphasizes the importance of pragmatically designing IT systems to meet the specific needs of the business. By only architecting an IT system as far as needed, teams can be more agile, responsive to changing needs and deliver value to their customers more quickly.

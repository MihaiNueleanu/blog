The following is a list of my favorite tools, most of which I use in my daily life, digital and otherwise. I try to use open source, minimalist software, but that doesn't always work out.

---

### General

- **Operating System** - Ubuntu, Mac, and rarely Windows
- **Development** - VSCode, for almost anything, even Java
- **Shell** - zsh (with oh-my-zsh)
- **GitHub** - primary source control for all projects
- **Pass** - the standard unix password manager
- **Obsidian** - note-taking (some call it second brain)

---

### Infrastructure

Generally I prefer using Kubernetes, and containers whenever possible. I find that the automation and tooling are unbeatable.

- **[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/)** - Used as cloud for [kOps](https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/), aka easy-to-use kubernetes
- **[Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) & [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) & [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki)** - Logging and Monitoring
- **[k9s](https://k9scli.io/)** - IDE for Kubernetes clusters
- **[ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)** - Best Kubernetes CD automation

### Languages

I'm agnostic when it comes to any tools, and programming languages are no different for me. I believe that having a good understanding of the overarching software engineering concepts is much more important than being a specialist in one particular syntax.

- **Go** - Big fan, I admire a language that's slim on features
- **TypeScript** - De-facto best general-purpose, backend, frontend, scripting language when not in an enterprise
- **Python** - Best for rapid iterating. I'm still missing better types and better async support
- **C#** - Nice language for enterprise-projects

---

### Databases

- **Postgres** - Favorite SQL database
- **MongoDB** - (Ex)Favorite no-sql database. Would choose postgres over it any day
- **Redis** - Favorite database for cache
- **Kafka** - Favorite event streaming platform (database? it's complicated...)

---

### Frontends

- **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** - Top favourite ATM. It turns out it was building the right abstractions this whole time.
- **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)** - Ex-favorite, love the minimalism. I like vue's "boring" and stable track record better.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - Nobody's favorite, but it's got the best game in town. De-facto choice, if perception is a factor
- **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** - Best cross platform app development platform. For simplicity, I use it via [Expo](https://expo.io/)
- **[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)** - Favorite fullstack framework for web-sites and web-apps

### Awesome random stuff

- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) - Simplest static site generator
- [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) - Simple file sync between machines
- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) - Graph Database for when you're sick of joins
- [Beekeeper studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/) - The smoothest, best looking, and easiest to use SQL client for MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, SQL Server, and more.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - Second brain

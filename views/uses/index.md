The following is a list of my favorite tools, most of which I use in my daily life, digital and otherwise. I try to use open source, minimalist software, but that doesn't always work out.

---

### General

- **Operating System** - Ubuntu, Mac, Windows, yes all of them
- **Development** - VSCode, for almost anything, even Java
- **Shell** - zsh (with oh-my-zsh)
- **WSL** - absolute must when on Windows
- **GitHub** - primary source control for all projects
- **Pass** - the standard unix password manager

---

### Infrastructure

Generally I prefer using Kubernetes, and containers whenever possible. I find that the automation and tooling are unbeatable.

- **[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)** - Kubernetes
- **[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/)** - [K3S](https://k3s.io/), on a cheap and "good enough" VPS provider
- **[Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana) & [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) & [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki)** - Logging and Monitoring
- **[Lens](https://k8slens.dev/)** - IDE for Kubernetes clusters
- **[ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)** - Best Kubernetes CD automation
- **[DockerHub](http://dockerhub.com/)** - Container repository and automated CI

### Languages

I'm agnostic when it comes to any tools, and programming languages are no different for me. I believe that having a good understanding of the overarching software engineering concepts is much more important than being a specialist in one particular syntax.

- **C#** - Best language for professional use. The more experienced I get, the more I admire the language design
- **TypeScript** - Amazing for greenfield backends and a must for frontend
- **Python** - Best for rapid iterating. I'm missing better types and better async support
- **Go** - Big fan, would love some professional mileage on it

---

### Databases

- **Postgres** - Favorite SQL database
- **MongoDB** - Favorite general purpose database
- **Redis** - Favorite "cache" database
- **Kafka** - Favorite event streaming platform (database? it's complicated...)

---

### Frontends

- **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)** - Top favorite ATM, love the minimalism. It still needs some work on the dev tools.
- **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** - Ex-favorite, wish it was a better fit with TypeScript
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - Nobody's favorite, but it's got the best game in town. De-facto choice, if perception is a factor
- **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** - Best cross platform app development platform. For simplicity, I use it via [Expo](https://expo.io/)
